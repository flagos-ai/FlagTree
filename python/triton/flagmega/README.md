# FlagMega

FlagMega is a Python-native, staged model compiler for FlagTree, organized around
nncase-style IR, rewriting, target policies, TIR and runtime contracts. Python IR
is an executable serialization format for editing and resuming compilation, not
just a debug dump. The compiler can run unattended; a user or agent can also
inspect a checkpoint, edit it, override a selection and resume through the CLI.

`F.nn.rope(value, cos, sin, rotary_dim=64)` represents partial RoPE directly,
without Slice/Concat nodes. `rotary_dim` is a positive even scalar-coordinate
prefix length, bounded by the input head dimension; omitting it preserves full-head
rotation and the existing serialized contract. Tables cover only that prefix.
The tail is copied unchanged. `F.ntt.vectorized_rope` uses the same scalar units
after packing. RoPE promotes inputs and tables independently to FP32, computes the products
and sum in FP32, and rounds only the result back to the input dtype, as nncase
does. `F.nn.rotary_embedding(..., output_dtype="bfloat16")` expresses a rounded
table directly at its producer's store boundary. Thus a numerical profile can
use BF16 input/output and BF16 tables without surrounding RoPE Cast nodes;
normalization's separate rounding boundaries remain unchanged.

`F.nn.sparse_experts` decomposes before AutoDistribution into Dispatch
(`[T,H] -> [T,R,H]`), GateUp, per-route FP32 Down, and Combine. `R` is a
selected route slot, not the expert-bank axis. These stages independently model
token/route/feature ownership and cost; weight-bank expert axes remain broadcast.
After distribution, private Dispatch/GateUp and Down/WeightedSum pairs fuse
locally. Route and split-K owner sums remain explicit Boxing operations before
the final cast; per-route rounding cannot cross an unfinished K reduction.
This is static route parallelism, not dynamic expert-owner all-to-all dispatch.
Qwen3.5 shared experts use an independent, always-active group with their own
sigmoid coefficient, outside routed TopK normalization. Different intermediate
widths retain separate groups and costs without padding their weight banks.

## Workspace implementation summary

| Area | Implemented responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| `importer` | Checkpoint-backed model import; Qwen3 entry/decode function separation during import, embedding, paged attention, FFN, final projection and sampling. |
| `ir` | Per-operation modules; colocated operation semantics and parameter/type contracts; handwritten functional builders; symbolic dimensions, vector/distributed types, graph functions and TIR. |
| `pattern_match`, `rules` | Typed patterns, parameter descriptors, dataflow rewrites and reusable rule/pass-level tests. |
| `egraph` | Typed equality saturation and OR-Tools CP-SAT extraction, including acyclic extraction constraints; graph/cost/pick diagnostics. |
| `passes` | TargetIndependent, TargetDependent, AutoPacking, AutoDistribution and TIR pass groups; real vectorization, packing, distribution and bufferization transformations. |
| `diagnostics` | Pass/stage Before and After directories, per-function names, dump flags, editable Python IR and readable `.il`/`.script` companions. |
| `evaluator`, `artifacts` | Lazy constant islands compatible with graph/egraph rewriting, reference evaluation, readonly-data materialization/cache, section hashes and artifact validation. |
| `targets` | Target-machine capabilities, selection policies, implementation catalogs and launch/package contracts, separated from model import. |
| `codegen/triton` | Kernel-family/variant/platform templates; function-level producer/consumer regions; reusable decode functions, kernel definitions and tensor-map tables. |
| `runtime` | Prepared launches, argument binding, persistent state, descriptors, compiler scratch and explicit resource/spill validation. |
| `serving` | Standalone artifact-only prompt prefill and decode, chat templates, prefix-cache reuse, sampling, interactive CLI and per-turn performance metrics. |

Bufferization models memory spans, aliases, lifetimes and synchronization; it
uses a CP-SAT allocator by default, or verified first-fit for fast iteration. Distribution
uses a 2D mesh in the validated configuration. Ordinary kernels consume local
shards; communication/boxing implementations own the necessary distributed
coordination.

The supporting TLE changes preserve pipe endpoints and synchronization across
noinline calls, carry shared offsets and compiler scratch across function
boundaries, and maintain legal explicit memory layouts and asynchronous copies.
They include standalone MLIR, Python/GPU and C++ regression tests. TLE-specific
native changes are compile-time guarded; the Python/backend hooks are gated.

Repeated cleanup removed unnecessary native changes and the public
`rematerialize_index` and exact-physical-warp-allocation controls. Physical warp
allocation now uses ordinary four-warp padding. Device calls still retain a
fixed register ABI; logical single-warp producer functions remain supported.
The allocator's remaining native delta is 17 lines against the development
base, including guards/comments.

## CLI and editable IR

### PreOps and PostOps

`Fusion` is a closed, typed unary IR function, built with ordinary `F.*`
expressions. `F.with_ops` attaches these functions to an existing operation:
PreOps bind to its `ParameterInfo` inputs and PostOps bind to its result fields.
The base op keeps its own schema and implementation; no per-op dtype switches
or source strings are needed.

```python
from triton.flagmega import ir as fm
from triton.flagmega.ir.ops.nn.softmax import Softmax

@fm.fusion(fm.tensor_type("bfloat16", (4, 32)))
def widen(value):
    return fm.F.tensors.cast(value, "float32")

class Graph(fm.Module):
    def forward(self):
        value = self.input("value", widen.input_type)
        result = fm.F.with_ops(fm.F.nn.softmax, value,
                              pre_ops={Softmax.value: widen}, axis=-1)
        self.function("main", (value,), (result,))
```

Python checkpoints emit `@fm.fusion` definitions and `F.with_ops` calls; their
bodies can be edited and resumed normally. `.il`/`.script` show inline typed
fusion expressions. Visitors enter these semantic bodies, and
`body.rewrite(rules)` runs ordinary dataflow rules within their own SSA scope.
Existing rules do not implicitly treat a fused call as a naked op; a rule that
understands these boundaries declares `supports_fusion=True`. Fusion bodies
participate in inference-cache keys, e-graph identity and cost accounting.

The PyNTT target registers shared Pattern rules in the existing
`FuseDistributedOps` DataflowPass. Automatic fusion currently covers unary
casts/activations around **elementwise and scalar-axis softmax** kernels.
Elementwise supports explicit vectorized-cast lane repacking. Manually authored
bodies may also contain supported binary expressions and local constants.
Shared producers are not duplicated. Backend capability checks reject
unsupported bodies/families, partial reductions and effectful boundaries;
they never silently drop a Fusion. Other kernel families require explicit
boundary-emitter support before they can use this facility.

`FuseDistributedOps` also forms `NTT.PagedAttentionGatedCombine` from a private
attention combine followed by `attention * sigmoid(gate)`. Unlike a unary
`Fusion`, this op has four explicit operands: max/sum/acc partial states and
the gate. It preserves both BF16 producer rounding boundaries and the final
product type. Output and gate must have identical types and owners; the
combine's released partial axis may become an output split. Shared/exported
attention intermediates are not removed or recomputed. Formation and layout
validation precede TIR implementation selection, and normal bufferization
plans gate-side views, cross-owner state reads, lifetimes and barriers. The
portable Triton implementation shares the ordinary combine algorithm and
performs gating before its output store.

Private numeric casts can commute through read-only ShardedView and
scalar-element-preserving Bitcast lane views before boundary fusion. This
exposes a conversion to its consuming kernel without materializing a wide
temporary. Inference must preserve the result type and owner mapping; shared
or exported casts, partial values, numeric bit reinterpretation and
non-trailing Bitcast lane regrouping are not moved. This rule is value-exact
and does not remove an intermediate rounding step.

TargetIndependent's `FoldCast` independently eliminates identity casts and
floating `A → B → A` round trips. This is a **relaxed numerical optimization**:
the intermediate rounding is intentionally discarded, including narrowing
round trips. Integer/boolean conversions and non-round-trip chains are not
covered. PreOps/PostOps do not perform this simplification. Selecting an
importer numerical profile alone therefore does not promise full-sequence
token equality after relaxed optimization; validate the intended workload.

### Commands

Use a FlagTree environment built with NVIDIA/TLE support. The package installs
the `flagmega` CLI by default; `python -m triton.flagmega` is equivalent.
`FLAGTREE_FLAGMEGA=0` disables the optional console entry point and its extra
installation dependencies. Core extraction requires `ortools==9.10.4067`, with
no greedy-extraction fallback; templates use Jinja2. GPU execution additionally
needs the corresponding CUDA/PyTorch environment and model checkpoint.

```sh
python -m triton.flagmega --help
python -m triton.flagmega import --model /path/to/checkpoint --output imported.py
python -m triton.flagmega verify imported.py
python -m triton.flagmega inspect imported.py --json
python -m triton.flagmega compile --input imported.py --checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint \
  --target nvidia-sm90 --output /path/to/artifact --emit-executable \
  --work-dir /path/to/dumps --dump-flags all
python -m triton.flagmega artifact verify /path/to/artifact
```

Additional commands include `stage`, `candidates`, `select`, `diff`, `schedule`,
`resume`, `replay` and `artifact run`; use each command's `--help` for its inputs.
Import defaults to the first decode layer; `--full-model` imports the complete
model. JSON CLI output is an inspection/report format, not a replacement for
the editable Python IR. Only load trusted Python checkpoints: loading executes
their Python builders.

Readable `.il`/`.script` dumps use function-local short SSA names on the left
and original node IDs in trailing `name=...` comments. Constants and weight
references are typed inline operands; splats stay compressed and weights are
never loaded for printing. Constant recipes use the same notation. Computations
with shared users remain single SSA definitions, and each function prints its
own body. These display names do not rename the IR or change executable Python
checkpoints, semantic hashes, selection plans, or generated kernels.

Each function groups proven weight/constant preprocessing into an internal
`weights { ... }` section, using `%w0`, `%w1`, etc.; the compute body has its own
`%0`, `%1` numbering. Frozen recipes also live in the consuming function's
weights section. This is only a display grouping, not a scope, scheduling
region, or claim that an operation has already been folded. No extra dump
files are created. Classification follows immutable dependencies and the op's
constant-evaluation/determinism contracts, not names such as `pack` or `weight`.
DumpManager proves constant parameters across all call sites before splitting
function views, and shares that read-only analysis across their renders. A
standalone callee without caller context keeps unproven parameter expressions
in its compute body. Dynamic inputs, effects and physical TIR calls remain in
the execution body.

After post-boundary vector-layout propagation, `PackResultProducers` moves
embedding feature packing into the weight table (nncase Gather propagation)
and makes rotary-table producers return vector elements directly. It rebuilds
each producer once in dataflow order, preserving shared scalar consumers and
the single position-state read. A subsequent egraph pass folds inverse layout
boundaries. No Pack-to-Bitcast normalization is used to hide activation packing.

An executable artifact contains `ir/final.py`, the readable companion
`ir/final.script`, generated source, readonly data and a checked manifest.
Custom implementation catalogs must match the saved target snapshot when
resuming target verification. Regenerate generated source after API changes;
retired names are not silently accepted by compatibility shims.

Before freezing readonly-data recipes, `LiftConstantParameterExpressions`
uses all call sites to prove constant function arguments, including through
nested wrappers. Pure, deterministic, constant-evaluable expressions over
fixed-size immutable tensors move to each caller; the reusable callee accepts
their results through one refined ABI. Weights may differ between calls and
no `packed_from` annotation is required. Shared users, exported parameters and
runtime call order are preserved. Stop at `lift-constant-parameters` (IR stage
`constant_parameters_lifted`) to edit these ordinary Python expressions before
`FreezeConstantIslands`. Frozen or already lowered TIR must be resumed from an
earlier checkpoint to perform this transformation.

Readonly-data verification streams bounded chunks and checks both the whole
image and every indexed entry. One worker hashes the image while the calling
thread hashes entry slices over the same immutable chunk; each chunk completes
before the next read. This overlaps CPU work without caching trust decisions,
skipping hashes, or making a full-image copy. Worker failures are propagated.

### Bufferization optimization levels

Use `CompileOptions(bufferize_opt_level="fast")` or `--bufferize-opt-level fast`
for deterministic first-fit allocation during iteration. Use `optimized` (the
target default) for final memory planning: CP-SAT minimizes pool high-water,
then optionally reduces proven reuse-only synchronization conflicts without
increasing any pool. First-fit supplies an initial placement, hints and upper
bound. All SAT objectives share the configured per-allocation time budget;
there is no address-sum objective. Pool records retain solver status and bounds,
so a feasible placement is not presented as a proven optimum.

Both levels use the same alias/MemSpan analysis, inclusive lifetimes, alignment,
capacity checks, call ABI verification and synchronization realization. Fast
can require more memory or synchronization; it does not silently fall back to
SAT when a pool does not fit. Exact physical allocation problems are cached
within one bufferization run, including baseline/preferred planning and function
specialization. Readonly data remains linearly allocated.

Changing levels requires resuming the Python IR **before Bufferize**, normally
the `PlanFunctionMemory/After` or `Bufferize/Before` directory. Already allocated
checkpoints cannot simply be relabeled: offsets, call bindings, synchronization
and generated source must all be regenerated. Omitting the flag when resuming
an allocated checkpoint preserves its saved level.

For example, compile an imported decode module for iteration, then resume its
complete pre-Bufferize dump with SAT for the final build:

```sh
python -m triton.flagmega compile --input imported.py --output build/fast \
  --bufferize-opt-level fast --work-dir build/fast-dumps --dump-flags compile,pass-ir
python -m triton.flagmega resume --input /path/to/Bufferize/Before \
  --output build/optimized --bufferize-opt-level optimized \
  --work-dir build/optimized-dumps --dump-flags compile,pass-ir
```

The second input is the function-complete `Before` directory produced by the
first command, not its allocated output. Add `--emit-executable` and
`--checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint` to materialize runnable artifacts; these examples otherwise
compile IR and do not load weights or measure device execution. The same level
option is available on `compile`, `resume`, `replay` and `stage`.

AutoDistribution shares exact type-inference, reshard and realized-cost queries
within a search. Fixed choices are propagated through exact compatibility
relations before CP-SAT variables are constructed; candidate IDs remain
unchanged and distinct weights remain independent decisions. `DistributedSearchGraph.dot`
retains all candidates; `Costs/Pick.dot` contains only the selected subgraph.
The pass analysis manager can reuse an unchanged proposal during uninterrupted
compilation. Pausing/resuming creates a fresh manager, and an intervening custom
pass invalidates this analysis unless it explicitly declares preservation.
Custom passes that mutate target/provider policy must not claim preservation.

For verified typed operations, `OpDefinition.zero_copy_input_index` proves a
read-only physical alias without repeating type inference. Dense Reshape,
Bitcast and legal ShardedView contracts use it; byte preservation alone is not
enough for strided or opaque layouts. Alias reshapes have zero execution cost.
Internal read-only views of one immutable producer share a grid-publication
cost, including tuple fields and alias chains. CP-SAT charges the logical OR
of their selected uses, weighted by function invocations. Boxing transfers,
independent producers and ownership-exclusive transitions remain separate.
`Costs/Pick.txt` separates edge costs from shared publication groups; DOT edges
show standalone estimates, which must not be summed as the solver objective.
Packed QKV and its partial combine expose operation-owned cost factors using
the target's arithmetic, bandwidth and synchronization rates. Matmul residual
norm combines count the partial fan-in over their requested output region,
including scalar vector lanes in the reduction work. Unknown shapes
remain explicitly heuristic. These estimates do not include allocation-induced
WAR barriers or post-distribution fusion savings and are not measured latency.

Distribution providers use operation-owned forward and inverse type relations.
`distributed_output_type_candidates` lifts available input contracts;
`infer_distributed_input_types` projects a requested output into input tuples,
and forward inference must reproduce that exact output. Same-type scalar/vector
binary and unary ops share this contract instead of enumerating a fixed tensor
axis. Broadcasting remains explicit, partial nonlinear work is rejected, and
dtype/lane changes cannot be invented to satisfy an output demand. Pointwise
input domains are joined by exact type, not expanded as a Cartesian product.
Before CP-SAT, a monotone worklist propagates new producer layouts and consumer
demands through declared provider relations and structural tuples. Real reshard
edges, costs, capability checks and function ABIs remain explicit. Policy v10
requires fresh proposals; old catalogs are not silently reinterpreted.

`LowerVectorizationContracts` preserves byte-view chains connecting native
computations, including a scalar Bitcast over a vector Reshape. Such a physical
chain is no longer reconstructed as a scalar schedule plus a new Unpack.
SplitStages retain their coordinate-mapping order, while `SBPPartial.axes` is a
canonical owner set. Collective enumeration and MatMul K-axis validation must
not confuse these two contracts.

`FreezePreDistributionConstants` now outlines all proven constant islands before
the distribution proposal, after packing/function-boundary propagation. This is
the default pipeline, not a model-specific option: source kinds, purity,
determinism and constant-evaluation contracts determine the boundary. The search
sees opaque `const_asset` leaves and still selects every runtime layout and
reshard edge; offline Slice/Concat/Pack interiors do not generate candidates.
No weight payload is loaded. `pre-distribution-freeze` produces the editable,
resumable `distribution_constants_frozen` checkpoint.

After distribution is materialized, `post-distribution-thaw` explicitly restores
ordinary constant expressions (`distribution_constants_open`), retaining the
chosen runtime graph and boundary types. Recipe-local names are renamed only
when necessary to avoid collisions; physical layout changes use explicit
Boxing edges rather than rewriting the types of internal expressions. Constant
physical vector computations remain intact during vector-contract lowering.
The existing ConstantCSE, LiftConstantParameterExpressions and final
FreezeConstantIslands then absorb new constant adapters and caller expressions
into closed readonly-data recipes. Default Dataflow/EGraph rewriters still
reject frozen IR; no frozen-phase checks or offline passes are bypassed.
Existing open distribution proposals retain their saved selection surface when
resumed. New plans must be selected from their own compact proposal.

`AutoDistributedPass` finishes with `fuse-attention-gate`, after distributed
boundary propagation and vector-contract lowering. Its `attention_gate_fused`
checkpoint already contains legal private attention-combine/sigmoid/multiply
epilogues, before constant freezing or tutorial-local fusion passes. This stage
uses the selected distributed types, not microkernel decisions. Shared or
exported attention results remain unfused. The later `FuseDistributedOps` pass
also recognizes the pattern so older frozen checkpoints can still resume;
recognition is idempotent.

### Tensor views and alignment contracts

Qwen3.5's default importer now exposes `nn.qkv_parallel_linear` plus a separate
gate projection. The checkpoint's per-head query/gate interleaving is decoded
with ordinary constant Reshape/Slice operations outside the reusable decoder.
Q/K/V therefore use the existing packed-QKV distribution, fused-RHS and kernel
selection path without activation slices. Existing explicitly requested flat
QKVG imports remain a distinct representation, not an alias for QKVParallel.

Contiguous same-owner Slice/SliceToShape values can become
`F.tir.buffer_subspan(value, offsets=..., shape=...)`. Contiguity is proved in
both logical and local-shard coordinates, including vector elements. The view
retains a typed MemSpan, source lifetime, byte offset and owner stride; it is
not a byte-preserving reinterpretation of the entire parent allocation.
Non-contiguous slices, changed ownership, mandatory snapshot writes, explicit
copy-placement constraints and unsupported escaping result ABIs retain a real
materialization.

Storage decisions precede implementation selection:

```text
CanonicalizePackedQKVWeights
PlanTIRAlignments       -> aligned_tir
LowerTensorSubspans     -> tensor_subspans_lowered
ProposeTIRMicroKernels
SelectTIRMicroKernels
FinalizeTIRPackage / PlanFunctionMemory / Bufferize
```

`T.prim_parameter(..., alignment_bytes=...)` records the semantic storage ABI.
Planning covers the alignment requirements of currently legal implementation
interfaces, independent of candidate preferences or selection records. This
conservative common ABI preserves those implementation options. Explicitly
declared contracts remain authoritative. A different storage tradeoff requires
replanning before the subspan boundary, not changing a later microkernel pick.
Microkernel proposal/application only admit implementations satisfying the
contract; they neither strengthen it nor change copy/view decisions.

Alignment requirements propagate through aliases and reusable function inputs
and results. Allocation realizes them for every owner, padding compact owner
strides when necessary. Subspans preserve the parent's stride. Python IR,
buffer-plan verification, specialization and generated call ABIs retain these
facts. Legacy parameters without an alignment field keep their existing
transfer ABI when resumed; new compilation commits the contract before views.

### Source-runtime numerical contracts

Import may explicitly select a versioned numerical profile. The default
`nncase` preserves the existing import. Full-model Qwen3 BF16 also supports
`vllm-493bd8323-inductor-level3`, describing that revision/configuration's
normalization, residual, rotary-table and activation rounding boundaries:

```sh
python -m triton.flagmega import --model /path/to/checkpoint --full-model \
  --numerical-profile vllm-493bd8323-inductor-level3 --output imported.py
```

The Python API is `import_model(..., numerical_profile=...)`;
`apply_numerical_profile(module, profile)` supports trusted imported checkpoints.
Unsupported profiles, changing an existing contract, and applying a profile to
lowered IR are errors. `compile --input` respects the saved contract; an explicit
conflicting `--numerical-profile` is rejected. The pinned profile currently
requires the reusable `decode_layer` full-model importer, not the legacy
hidden-output layer importer. This is not a numerical-equivalence claim for
arbitrary vLLM revisions or settings.

Qwen3.5 MoE's default import keeps the hidden/residual, gate and MoE dataflow
in BF16. Router/logits MatMul producers directly declare FP32 outputs; import
does not manufacture activation Casts to reproduce a source runtime's rounding.
Normalization's immutable `1 + w` preparation still uses FP32 constant
expressions, which the normal constant-lifting/freezing pipeline evaluates
offline. The optional `vllm-ae10e855a-inductor-level3` profile explicitly restores
its wider residual ABI and projection rounding for compatibility experiments;
it is not the default required by tutorial 02.

Profiles are frontend semantics, not codegen model switches. Ordinary
TargetIndependent passes fuse BF16 projections with FP32 GLU intermediates and
FP32 Q/K normalization/RoPE using explicit operation attributes. They preserve
projection/table/final rounding boundaries and cache effects, including values
returned by functions. CLI compilation and edit/resume need no tutorial imports
or agent intervention to obtain these fusions. Generic correctness fixes and
optimizations live here; workload/hardware selection strategies may remain local.

Local fusions are Pattern-based rules grouped in dataflow fixed points:
`DecomposeComplexOps` includes normalization decomposition, wide GLU, final
NormApply casts and QKV/RoPE/cache formation; `FuseDistributedOps` groups the
gather/reduce normalization variants. Patterns bind shared operands and
private users; callbacks check type/layout, rounding and effect-order legality.
`is_unary_chain` captures arbitrary-length view chains in both dataflow and
e-graph matching. Multi-output/effectful region edits are dataflow transactions,
not e-graph equalities. Late rules use `rewrite_constants=False` to keep frozen
assets and recipes opaque. Legacy fusion stage names resolve to their grouped
stage for checkpoint resume.

`QKVRoPEWithCache` requires materialized Q/K tensors and two mandatory FP32
statistics operands. `NormStats` and any collective are separate IR nodes,
visible before AutoDistribution; no ten-input or gather/reduce-RoPE form remains.
`rotary_dim` uses scalar coordinates independent of vector lanes (omitting it
keeps full-head rotation). RoPE and QKVRoPEWithCache permit head-dimension
sharding only when every rotary pair belongs to one owner. The type relation
checks staged contiguous/block-cyclic ownership; incompatible inputs need an
explicit reshard before the op. Candidate generation lifts target splits of
rotary groups or paired halves and prices stats, collective and apply work
separately. The device implementation neither selects ownership nor reads
another owner's Q/K elements. Full-head normalization, the untouched normalized
tail, cache writes and sequence advancement remain part of the contract.

`NTT.AddNormStats` (`F.ntt.add_norm_stats`) adds two values and returns the
rounded sum plus additive normalization statistics. Its first input may be
materialized or Sum-partial; it does not perform a matrix multiplication or
require a MatMul producer. `NTT.MatMulNormStats` is the distinct operation that
also performs the projection. The former `MatMulNormStatsCombine` name is not
an alias; regenerate old checkpoints from an earlier stage when resuming.

`FormAddNormStats` handles equal-shaped additions before AutoDistribution,
including residuals whose producer is not a MatMul. Layout search jointly
prices private, layout-compatible packed MatMul/AddNormStats regions using
the same typed rule as `LowerAddNormStats`. The fused operation owns local
projection/add/statistics work; statistics collectives and value publication
remain explicit and separately priced. Cost dumps distinguish standalone
candidate prices from the joint price actually charged, including static
function invocation counts. Shared/escaping projections, layout-changing
edges, and edited or non-analytic candidate costs receive no fusion discount.
For a multi-result producer, a value publication and a statistics reduction
share the same input-completion barrier. Search charges that barrier once per
invocation, including callee returns, while retaining each reduction's data
transfer and arithmetic costs. Independent producers never share completion.
PyNTT applies its canonical-storage view proof to callee-owned return values
as well as internal uses, rather than requiring an artificial copy at every
function return. This does not grant canonical provenance to an unknown
function parameter or turn a Partial reduction into a view.

`HoistCallInvariantExpressions` is a normal TargetIndependent pass with its own
Before/After checkpoints. It lifts pure expressions of identical immutable SSA
arguments across repeated calls, computes them once per caller, and refines the
shared callee ABI. It does not move state reads or infer equal values from names
or types. Mixed-dtype NormApply vectorization and MatMulNormStats fusion
respect the declared projection output dtype and residual conversion chain. Generic distributed
inference exposes target-owned leaf layouts at logical-argument use sites,
allowing shard-local casts without changing the originator's external ABI.

`NormApply.output_dtype` expresses a final conversion separately from input
arithmetic/rounding precision. Normalization still rounds in the input dtype
before converting its output; the ordinary private-output cast rule and both
gather/reduce normalization forms preserve this contract. Optional in-place
aliases require compatible physical types, including in reusable callees.
`MatMulNormStats.addend_cast_dtypes` similarly records an ordered residual
conversion chain executed before addition. The packed-matmul lowering can fold
private cast chains with identical endpoint shard types into this epilogue,
removing intermediate buffers without removing numerical rounding or crossing
communication boundaries. Both attributes are omitted for the original default
contract and round-trip through executable Python IR.

`F.math.matmul(..., output_data_type="float32")` selects a true FP32 projection
from narrow inputs; vectorization, packing, normalization fusion and codegen
carry that attribute. The evaluator and kernel do not materialize a BF16 result
before widening it. Missing output dtype preserves the original implicit dtype.
Under the current relaxed target-independent policy, a private BF16 MatMul
followed by a widening Cast can become an FP32-output MatMul; this deliberately
removes the BF16 result rounding and is not an exact-arithmetic equality.

Wider vector elements preserve logical coordinates by splitting packets. With
a 16-byte packet, eight narrow elements become `f32<2,4>` at the same outer shape,
not `f32<4>` at twice the outer extent. Repeated vector axes map both components
to the same logical axis. AutoVectorize offers coherent region defaults through
shape-preserving dataflow and declared reusable-call ABIs, so residual Add/Norm
can directly consume this producer layout; explicit agent selections remain
authoritative and round-trip in Python proposals.

## Standalone text serving

```sh
python -m triton.flagmega.serving.chat_cli --artifact "$ARTIFACT" \
  --checkpoint "$CHECKPOINT" --n-predict 128 --metrics-file .local/chat.jsonl
```

This path does not import vLLM or use a Transformers model forward. It loads
tokenizer/config files from the checkpoint and executes a full-vocabulary,
single-token paged-attention artifact for both prompt ingestion and generation.
Prefill is explicitly a compiled-token causal scan, not batched prefill.
The stored numerical-profile name does not introduce a source-runtime dependency.

The interaction conventions follow the [llama.cpp CLI](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/master/tools/cli):
system prompts, tokenizer chat templates, streaming replies, and per-response
timings. Use `/reset`, `/stats`, `/help`, `/exit`, or multiline input ending in
`\`. `--prompt` runs one turn; `--interactive` continues afterward. Raw prompt
or token-file completion, greedy or seeded temperature/top-k/top-p sampling,
EOS handling, and explicit context limits are supported. No implicit history
truncation or context shifting is performed.

Metrics separate loading/JIT/graph preparation, prompt evaluation, cached tokens,
TTFT, decode mean/median/p95 latency, decode throughput, total generation time,
and output throughput. JSONL also records memory usage and artifact/serving-source
identities. Decode counts exclude the first output token produced by prefill.
Interactive callbacks are timed; human input wait and setup are not. CUDA Graph
is the default; `--no-cuda-graph` selects eager execution explicitly.

## Latest validated state

The development workspace validated Qwen3-1.7B on NVIDIA H800, including a
complete first-layer path and the full 28-layer decode model, batch 1. This is
not an acceptance claim for Qwen3.8-27B FP8, all shapes or other backends.

- Single-layer three-step CPU/GPU reference checks passed: tokens
  `2176 / 25 / 2096`, minimum logits cosine `0.9999839067`.
- Full-model three-step nncase reference checks passed: tokens `25 / 220 / 16`,
  minimum cosine `0.9996560216`; logits were byte-identical before and after the
  final warp-allocation cleanup.
- Final full-model resources: 12 physical warps, 143 registers/thread,
  172268 bytes shared, 331776 bytes global scratch; zero reported spill-store,
  spill-load, stack and local-memory bytes.
- The final executable instruction section is 261888 bytes, identical to the
  previously measured 12-warp diagnostic variant. The isolated 9-to-12-warp
  comparison used three rounds of 500 samples per variant/context, contexts
  1/128/1024, shared addresses, alternating order and a 256 MiB cache flush.
  Median changes ranged from -0.373% to +0.143%; no material regression was
  observed in that experiment. This is not a universal zero-overhead claim.

Latest targeted validation before publication:

| Targeted TLE Python/GPU tests | 72 passed, 1 skipped |
| Publication CLI, namespace, template and sampling smoke checks | 30 passed |
| Selected native MLIR/LLVM tests | 205 passed, 13 pre-existing failures; unchanged failure set |
| Single-layer/full-model artifacts | Manifest, IR, readonly data and three-step references passed |

These numbers are targeted results, not a claim that the entire Triton test
matrix is green. Tests are under `python/test/flagmega`, `python/test/tle` and
`third_party/tle/{test,unittest}`. For example:

```sh
python -m pytest python/test/flagmega/codegen python/test/flagmega/runtime \
  python/test/flagmega/targets/nvidia/test_implementation_model.py -q
lit -v build/cmake.linux-x86_64-cpython-3.10/third_party/tle/test \
  build/cmake.linux-x86_64-cpython-3.10/test/Conversion/allocate_warp_groups.mlir
```

## Local development records

The original workspace keeps designs, iteration audits, ablation evidence,
benchmark inputs/results and v364 artifacts under ignored `build/flagmega/`.
Its latest records are `nncase_alignment_audit.md`,
`flagtree_change_necessity_audit.md`, `subwarpgroup_performance_v363.md` and
`subwarpgroup_cleanup_v364.md`. These local records, model weights, generated
binaries and retired-test archives are not included in the Git push. This
README provides a version-controlled summary; fresh checkouts must generate
their own artifacts using the source and an appropriate checkpoint.
